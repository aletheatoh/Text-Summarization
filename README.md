# SumRise

<p>An online portal that can summarize both web articles and raw text.</p>
<p>I was inspired by the words of my former swimming coach: "A good swimmer is a lazy swimmer with brains."</p>

### How to Use

#### Reading
User only needs to pass the URL of the web article, and a summary + title is auto-generated

#### Writing
User inputs some writing content and a summary is auto-generated
